## Description
A custom form maker that allows users to build their own forms easily and without any knowledge of coding or progamming. Users can create text boxes, passwords fields, drop down select boxes, radio boxes, checkboxes, and text areas.  Once the plugin is activated, the form and its settings can be found and edited under the "Pages" menu.  Call the form by using the shortcode [etm_contact_form].  
  
NOTE: This plugin currently supports only one form per website.
